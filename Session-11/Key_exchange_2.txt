Follow below steps for the Key Exchange

We currently have 2 ubuntu servers & we will use one as a controller node & other as a ansible host.

We will need to create a user called as "ansible" on both hosts & setup key exchange between them.



Run below commands on both the servers for creating the user

adduser ansible

You will be asked a few questions, starting with the account password.

This is not required and you can just hit ENTER in any field you wish to skip.

Granting admin privilege by entering below command

usermod -aG sudo ansible


Now we need to create an SSH key on the controller node & copy that onto the ansible host.

Run below command on the controller node

ssh-copy-id ansible@<ip address of ansible host>

Authenticate to Ubuntu host Using SSH Keys. Run below command from controller node

ssh ansible@<ip address of ansible host>

If this is your first time connecting to this host (if you used the last method above), you may see something like this:

Output
The authenticity of host '203.0.113.1 (203.0.113.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

This means that your local computer does not recognize the remote host. Type “yes” and then press ENTER to continue.
